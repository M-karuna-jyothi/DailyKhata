This application is being developed to solve one of the main problems our father who is a wholesale local brand dealer is facing.They have to go through monotonous process
of writing all sales data,stock data manually in books.Besides this, being a local brand dealer they have to keep track of sales details which they can get only from drivers
who are appointed to supply to shopkeepers.Majority of the drivers tend to forget where they delivered the product, and a few are irresponsible since the product is not theirs.
So this application will be deployed as a android app for storing sales data and location.The admin can store information and get information about stock and sales with just
few clicks.
This application can be further expanded and can be used by mnc companies as enterprise system which helps keep track of their sales.
